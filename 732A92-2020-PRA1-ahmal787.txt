Multi-Label Classification (MLC) deals with the problem where each instance is associated with multiple class labels. Binary Relevance (BR) and Classifier Chains (CC) are ones of the popular methods used to learn from multi-label examples. MLC problems usually come with different challanges, like proper evaluation metrics and class imbalance. This paper will discuss the application of BR and CC with three  Sinlge Class Classifiers, namely "Multivarate Naive Bayes" (MNB), "Logistic Regression" (LR) and "Linear Support Vector Classification" (LSVC) on Stack Overflow data which is processed with different selection of features and comparing the results using a range of evaluation metrics. BR and CC shows close performance except in computational efficiency where BR is about 1.3 to 4 times faster than CC. LR and SLVC are significantly more accurate than MNB, however the latter is faster than the other two. Also Jaccard Similarity and Sample, Micro and Weighted Averaging metrics by definition and empirically are more fitting metrics to MLC problems than Macro Averaging and to a lesser degree more than Hamming Loss and Subset Accuracy.
